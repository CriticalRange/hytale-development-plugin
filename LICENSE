GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

 0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular source code for the
Library is a Combined Work, and the Application is the "work that uses
the Library".  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work
means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including
any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined
Work.

 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

 2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, you may, at your option, convey
the modified version under the GNU Lesser General Public License in
addition to or as an alternative to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.  If you convey a modified version under this License, you may
not convey the modified version under version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or
fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and prominently stating that the Application is
licensed under this License and/or indicating that the Library is used
in it and covered by this License.

 4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU Lesser General
Public License.  If the Combined Work is a binary, you must also
convey the machine-readable Corresponding Application Code in a
publicly accessible manner, and prominently stating that the Combined
Work is licensed under this License and/or indicating that the Library
is used in it and covered by this License.

   c) For any Combined Work that includes the Library in object code,
also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Application Code in a
publicly accessible manner, and prominently stating that the Combined
Work is licensed under this License and/or indicating that the Library
is used in it and covered by this License.

   d) If the Library is distributed to you as object code, you must also
convey the machine-readable Corresponding Application Code in a publicly
accessible manner, and prominently stating that the Library is used in
it and covered by this License.

 5. Replaced Library Sections.

  You may replace the Library with a modified version of the Library,
provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
Application Code for the modified version of the Library in a publicly
accessible manner, and prominently stating that the modified version is
licensed under this License and/or indicating that the Library is used
in it and covered by this License.

 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it
and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library specifies that a proxy can decide whether future
versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
